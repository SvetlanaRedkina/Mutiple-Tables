# Mutiple-Tables

Writing tangled SQL queries is among my favorite work challenges 😊. I love pondering on how to improve my queries and pushing myself into looking for new solutions 🙋.
I find it particularly interesting to manipulate data which I extract from a variety of tables. This project is an example of what I often do when I am working with multiple tables.

## So what do we do in this project ❓

We create a complex SQL report on First Time No-Show Employee Rate utilizing CASE expression and CTE across multiple tables through repurposing aggregate functions for counting successful logical test runs.

We converte Employee Occupational Records into a form suitable for a report with the help of user-defined variables embedded into conditional statements.

Last, we calculate a statistical parameter within a department applying mathematical MySQL functions in conjunction with session variables.

## Project directory 👇

All tables, queries, and outputs are stored in Multiple tables.sql file. I have also included detailed explanations of the logic behind the queries. 

The screenshots of the tables with the inserted values into them in MySQL Workbench are available in Tables Screenshots folder.
